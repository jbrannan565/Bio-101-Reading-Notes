# BIO 101 Notes - Fall 2021 - WSU

These notes are for the Bio 101 class at WSU in Fall 2021. The goal of these notes is to summarize key ideas from the text in as few pages as possible with special emphasis on definitions. Note, they are **not** meant to *replace* other resources, but **are** meant to *supplement* them. I hope you find these to be useful.

Files are written in LaTex, and the actual content can be found in the pdf files.

## Notes Structure

Each directory corresponds with the OpenStax textbook that the notes are taken from. The notes will be titled by chapter, and contain all sections of the chapter within. For example, in "Ch_1.tex" the section numbered "1" will correspond to section "1.1" of the text.

There is also a "class_notes" directory, which is what one might guess. The notes are labeled by week and lecture number, as well as date.
